## How to use Python Script
Add the following files to the same folder:
* Python script
* JSON Spotify Listening Data Files

Use the following [link](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/apps "Named link title") to create a Spotify web developer app that will enable you to call the Spotify API. Paste the resulting client id and secret into the appropriate fields in the parameters section of your Python script.

Congrats, you're already ready to run everything! Please note that due to Spotify's API limits, the Python script may take a few hours to run if you're a big music lover like me.
